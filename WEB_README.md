This is the web app version of the pdf splitter.
Run the app.py script and it launches a server at localhost:5000.
Navigate there in a browser.
You can upload a pdf to be split.
it splits the file and then puts the individual pdf files into a zip file that you can then download. The page refreshes after 5 seconds so the download link is visible.
after downloading your files you can click the delete button and it clears out the split files so you can go again with a new input file.
